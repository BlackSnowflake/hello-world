My Story -
I'm Curtis Blake and I picked up web design as a hobby some time around the year 2000. I went to school for web desing and finally got BA in interactive media design. My favorite subjects were alwasy yhe flashy ones... litteraly, Macromedia Flash was my obsessiona as a student. By the time I graduated, Flash was owned by Adobe and I was on to other passions like Skiing and being in the outdoors. My temporary college job in online specialty outdoor retail became my full time career and that was it. 
At least until 2021 where I am looking to catch up on all the tech I missed while I was enjoying the outdoors. I'm hoping my future containsa little of both.
